# BitPostFilter

This is a WordPress plugin, it was created for a specific project, but it should work on any website. It allows users to filter posts (kind of advanced search without keywords) based on custom fields set to them. The filterable custom fields can be set in the plugin's options panel

At this point the plugin is not available on WordPress plugins directory and I don't think it will ever be.
